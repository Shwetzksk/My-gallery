Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
- It was fun doing this challenge. With each new challenges I got oppurtunity to learn, explore and to got better with my skill.
- What I learned/improved?
     - how to make image responsive
     - min-width and max-width (these properties always confused me and I am still trying to figure it out )
     -grid (I had used it before but not like my-gallery challenge)
     -this is first project that I have made responsive for all devices ( mobile and in landscape, tablet and above its size screen).
- Your wisdom? :)

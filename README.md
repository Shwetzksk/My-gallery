<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

  User story: I can see a page following the given design
  
- It was fun doing this challenge. With each new challenges I got oppurtunity to learn, explore and to got better with my skill.
- What I learned/improved?
     - how to make image responsive
     - min-width and max-width (these properties always confused me and I am still trying to figure it out )
     -grid (I had used it before but not like my-gallery challenge)
     -this is first project that I have made responsive for all devices ( mobile and in landscape, tablet and above its size screen).
- Your wisdom? :)
